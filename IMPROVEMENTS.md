Improvements
Improvement 1:
There is no distinct homepage; the first page the user interacts with is the product catalog. It would be beneficial to create a homepage with the e-commerce logo and decorative banners for a more professional appearance and broader reach.

Improvement 2:
Currently, the search begins with the first letter typed. It is suggested to trigger the search starting from the third or fifth letter to optimize performance and relevance of results.

Improvement 3:
There is no module for the user to create their account and password, and to manage payment information in a confidential and secure manner. This is essential for any e-commerce platform.

Improvement 4:
The "This field is required" message in the checkout forms would be more impactful if shown in red.
